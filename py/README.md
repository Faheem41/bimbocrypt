Welcome to the implementation of **Bimbocrypt** in ...
## Python

Things are now easier than ever. Previously one need to download dependencies like *numpy* and *privatefunc*. In the latest <a href="https://github.com/Faheem41/bimbocrypt/blob/main/py/version/bimbocrypt-1.2.22.py" rel="noreferrer">1.2.22</a> update everything is taken care of automatically. No hastle, just download the <a href="https://github.com/Faheem41/bimbocrypt/blob/main/py/src/bimbocrypt.py" rel="noreferrer">bimbocrypt.py</a> and use it. Otherwise have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/Faheem41/bimbocrypt/blob/main/py/test" rel="noreferrer">demo code</a>. </br>

Running the program first time might take some time, as it will download dependencies automatically. It is kindly recommended to keep the Internet connection on. From next time onwards things will run super-fast as limited by the <a href="https://github.com/Faheem41/bimbocrypt/blob/main/ALGORITHM" rel="noreferrer">Algorithm</a>.
